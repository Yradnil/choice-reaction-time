        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        You are about to play an aim trainer. For those who play video games should know how they work. 
        For those who dont know, don't worry. A circle will appear on your screen and your job is it to click 
        on it as fast as possible. The moment you clicked on the circle a new one will appear and so on.
        The game will continue for about a minute.
        Good luck!
    </p>

    <p>For now you will be playing only one round.</p>
